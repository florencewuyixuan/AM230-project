    "Let us consider a two-dimensional system consisting of $N$ identical disks of radius $a$. The instantaneous position of disk $i$ is given by the radius vector $\\mathbf{r}_i = x_i\\mathbf{e}_x+y_i\\mathbf{e}_y$. In addition, each disk is polar and its polarity is described by a vector $\\mathbf{n}_i = \\cos(\\vartheta_i)\\mathbf{e}_x + \\sin(\\vartheta_i)\\mathbf{e}_y$, where $\\vartheta_i$ is angle between $\\mathbf{n}_i$ and the $x-$ axis of the laboratory reference frame. It is immediately clear that $\\left|\\mathbf{n}_i\\right| = 1$."

In line with our key design philosophy of keeping things as detached from each other as possible, in this tutorial we treat these three steps as independent. The communication between different steps will be based on a shared file format, i.e., a code written to perform step 1 will produce output files in a format that the code in step 2 can directly read, etc.\n",

    "#### Creating the initial configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we need to generate the system we would like to study, i.e. we need to create the initial configuration for our simulation. Sometimes, as it is the case here, this is a fairly simple task. However, creating a proper initial configuration can also be a challenging task in its own right that requires a set of sophisticated tools to do. A good example would be setting up a simulation of several complex biomolecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the complexity, typically the result of this step is one (or several) text (sometimes binary) files that contain information such as the size of the simulation box, initial positions and velocities of all particles, particle connectivities, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use a set of simple Python scripts (located in *Python/pymd/builder* directory) to create the initial configuration that will be saved as a single JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let us build the initial configuration with a square simulation box of size $L=50$ with the particle number density $\\phi=\\frac{N}{L^2}=0.4$. We also make sure that centers of no two particles less than $a=1$ apart. Note that below we will assume that particles have unit radius. This means that our initial configuration builder allowed for significant overlaps between particles. In practice this is not a problem since we will be using soft-core potential and even large overlaps do not lead to excessive force. If one is to consider a system where particles interact via a potential with a strong repulsive component (e.g., the Lennard-Jones potential) the initial configuration would have to be constructed more carefully. \n",

In practice, this is technically the most challenging step and some of the most advanced particle based codes can contain hundreds of thousands of lines of code. \n",

Therefore, any naive implementation would be so slow that it would not be possible to simulate even the simplest systems within any reasonable time. For this reason, even the most basic particle based codes have to implement several algorithms that make the problem tractable. Furthermore, any slightly more complex problem would require parallelization, which is the topic of the last session in this tutorial. "

Although sometimes some basic analysis can be done by the main simulation code (i.e., in step 2), this is typically done a posteriori with a separate set of tools. Technically speaking, the main simulation code produces a file (or a set of files), often referred to as *trajectories*, that are loaded into the analysis code for post-processing. \n",

    "Even the most advanced particle-based simulations can simulate no more than several million particles. Most simulations are far more modest in size. A typical experimental system usually contains far more particles than it would be possible to simulate. Therefore, most simulations study a small section of an actual system and extrapolate the results onto the experimentally relevant scales. It is, therefore, important to minimize the finite size effects. One such approach is to use the  periodic boundary conditions."

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Neighbor list is one of the central parts of almost every particle-based code and yet is has almost nothing to do with physics. It is, however, a very handy tool to speed up calculations of forces and torques. Namely, with the exception of dealing with charged systems, most particle-particle interactions as pairwise and short-range. In other words, each particle interacts only with a handful of its immediate neighbors. In the example we study here, each particle interacts only with particles it overlaps with. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The most time consuming part of the simulation is the computation of forces acting on each particle. This computation has to be performed at each time step. At the face value, it is an $O(N^2)$ problem as for every particle one has to loop over the entire system. One can half the time by using the third Newton's law. However, in practice, this is usually not enough. For example, for a modest system with $10^3$ particles, the \"force loop\" would have to iterate $\\sim10^6$ times. \n",
    "    \n",
    "For a system with short range interactions it is immediately clear that the vast majority of terms in this double loop will be equal to zero. Therefore, it is highly beneficial to keep track of who the neighbors of each particle are and only include them in the calculation. The performance gain of this approach is hard to exaggerate, however, it comes at the cost of significant increase in code complexity, i.e., neighbor lists are not easy to implement.\n",

    "The idea is, however, simple. We keep a list of neighbors for each particle. All neighbors are within some cutoff distance (typically comparable to the interaction range). This cutoff is extended by a padding distance. If any of the particles moves more than half of the padding distance there is no longer guarantee that the current neighbor list represents the true state of the system and it has to be rebuild. Typically, one chooses the padding such that the neighbor list is rebuilt once every 10-20 time steps. This often requires some experimenting with parameters.\n",

Choosing the right method depends on the properties of the system of equations of interest and can often be very involved, especially if one requires a very accurate method (e.g., in studies of planetary dynamics). In the soft and active matter simulations, in most cases, using simple first- and second-order discretization schemes is usually sufficient. Since we are interested in collective behavior of a large number of particles and those particles scatter off of each other frequently, the precise knowledge of the trajectory of each particle is not essential.\n",

The key difference between first-order integrators used in this example and a velocity-Verlet scheme is that the later involves a \"pre-step\" (i.e., a half-step of length $\\frac{\\delta t}{2}$) before forces and torques are computed.

    "#### Final remarks on implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a full production-grade code, it would be convenient to add several more components. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Logger* classes would be in charge of handling logging of various observables that can be compute on \"fly\", such as the total energy of the system (arguably, of not much use in an active, self-propelled system), pressure, stress, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Event* classes would be reporting key events, such as reporting if the new *force* term was added, what is the frequency of saving the data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be useful to save the entire state of the simulation (i.e., all parameters for each particle and all forces, torques and integrators) for future restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key parts of any good code, which is, unfortunately, often overlooked is having a set of **automatic tests**. As the code grows in complexity, making sure that adding new features does not break the expected behavior of the existing components becomes a challenging task. A modular design that decouples different parts of the code from each other as much as possible, together with a powerful set of automatic tests is essential to make this task tractable. "
